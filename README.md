# fritz-ad-blocklist

Collects the top ad domains by collecting the common domains in an ad block list a the cloudflare top 1000 domains.

The resulting list is quite small (~250 entries) and can be used in limited environments such as a Fritz!Box because Fritz!Boxes are limited to only a few hundred entries in their domain block list.

The resulting list can be found [here](https://github.com/binarynoise/fritz-ad-blocklist/raw/data/top-ad-domains.txt)
